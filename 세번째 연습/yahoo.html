      <p>Yahoo! (/ˈjɑːhuː/)[7][8] is an American web services provider headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, and owned by Verizon Media.[9][10] The original Yahoo! company was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was incorporated on March 2, 1995.[11][12] Yahoo was one of the pioneers of the early Internet era in the 1990s.[13]

      It provides or provided a Web portal, search engine Yahoo! Search, and related services, including Yahoo! Directory, Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! News, Yahoo! Finance, Yahoo! Groups, Yahoo! Answers, advertising, online mapping, video sharing, fantasy sports, and its social media website. At its height it was one of the most popular sites in the United States.[14] According to third-party web analytics providers Alexa and SimilarWeb, Yahoo was the most widely read news and media website – with over 7 billion views per month – ranking as the sixth-most-visited website globally in 2016.[6][15][16]

      Once one of the largest Internet companies, Yahoo slowly declined starting in the late 2000s,[17][18] and in 2017 Verizon Communications acquired most of Yahoo's Internet business for $4.48 billion,[19][20][21] excluding its stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo! Japan, which were transferred to Yahoo's successor company Altaba.[22] Despite its decline from prominence, Yahoo domain websites are still among the most popular, ranking 10th in the world according to the Alexa rankings as of October 2019.[23]</p>
